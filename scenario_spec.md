# Scenario Manifest â€” `scenario.yaml`

A portable description of a model run. Check into git for provenance.

```yaml

```

## Rules
- **Only** specify changes; unspecified symbols inherit defaults from the template GDX/model.
- All referenced CSVs must be relative to the scenario file location.
- On run, the app creates a `patch.gdx` from `edits.*` and injects any `equations` includes.
